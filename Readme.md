Hereâ€™s a basic `README.md` template for your project, explaining how to clone the repository and run both the frontend (React) and backend (Django) projects:

# Vehicle Service System

This repository contains the frontend (React) and backend (Django) code for a vehicle service system. The frontend is located in the `frontend` folder and the backend is in the `backend` folder.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (for React frontend)
- [Virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) (for Python virtual environment)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Running the Backend (Django)

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply database migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Run the Django development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

Your Django backend will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### 3. Running the Frontend (React)

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Your React frontend will be running at `http://localhost:3000/`.

### 4. Accessing the Application

Once both the frontend and backend servers are running, you can open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000/` for the frontend. The frontend will interact with the backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Additional Commands
